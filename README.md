# nodecord
A powerful Node.js framework for create efficient and scalable discord bots with TypeScript.

# About this project
This project arose by the idea of create a framework similar as [nestjs](https://nestjs.com/), but for discord using some very popular modules like [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) and [Eris](https://abal.moe/Eris/). 

At the moment, the main version of this package and main branch of this repository will not have any functionally (at the moment) but we are going to develop in the dev branch of this repository.

# When this project will be ready?
The version 1.2.0 will launched when we have a good implementation with the latest versions of discord.js, with slash commands, etc. See the [branch dev](https://github.com/Datzu712/nodecord/tree/dev) for more information about the actual status of this project!
